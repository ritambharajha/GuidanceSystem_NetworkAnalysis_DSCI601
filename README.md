# GuidanceSystem_NetworkAnalysis_DSCI601
Guidance System for Retaliatory Violence in Rochester using Network Analysis



●	This project aims to create a network with suspects and victims involved in disputes ranging from years 2010 - 2014 in the Rochester Area. We obtained the dispute bulletins from the Rochester Police Department.
●	Networks are graphical representations of the connections (edges) between variables (nodes). Network analysis can predict complicated patterns of linkages, and the network structure may be analyzed to reveal key network elements.
●	We have a Python file to analyze the data and generate a network which is included with this document.
●	The coding environment used is Google Colab and will require python3 as well as the following packages: networkx, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn. 
●	Dataset is a pair of 2 excel files containing nodes and edges.
●	Node file contains - MCAC ID(number assigned to dispute bulletins by MCAC analysts), ID, Names and victim, suspect, witness.
●	Edge file contains - MCAC ID , ID, Name.
●	After the notebook is set up, the python file(.IPYNB) can be executed cell by cell.
●	Once executed successfully, users can see the generated network and the centrality graphs.
